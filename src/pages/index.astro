			<span slot="title">Minimalist & lightweight startpage</span>
			<p slot="desc">
				Bonjourr replaces your new tab page for something more refined and minimal. We took
				inspiration from Appleâ€™s design language to create a startpage that both looks
				amazing and feels great to use in your daily life.
			</p>

			<span slot="dynamic-title">Dynamic Backgrounds</span>
			<p slot="dynamic-desc">
				Bonjourr uses a manually selected collection of the best photos Unsplash has to
				offer. The mood of the photos changes according to the time of the day, from noon to
				the end of the night.
			</p>

			<span slot="custom-title">Customisable</span>
			<p slot="custom-desc">
				Because minimalism doesnâ€™t rhyme with lack of features, Bonjourr is stuffed with
				options. Add in your personal touch by changing the font, adding your own
				backgrounds or changing the look of your clock.
