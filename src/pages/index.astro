				Bonjourr replaces your new tab page for something more refined and minimal. We took
				inspiration from Appleâ€™s design language to create a startpage that both looks
				amazing and feels great to use in your daily life.

				Bonjourr uses a manually curated collection of the best photos Unsplash has to

				the end of the night.

			<span slot="custom-title">Customizable</span>
			<p slot="custom-desc">
				Because minimalism doesnâ€™t mean lacking in features, Bonjourr is packed with
				options. Add in your personal touch by changing the font, adding your own
				backgrounds, changing the look of your clock, enabling widgets and much more.
